# Online Library System

This Online Library System is developed as a project for the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence at Helwan University. It leverages ReactJS for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend to streamline library operations, serving both librarians and normal users.

## Features

### Librarian
- **Account Management**: Approve or reject user account registrations.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and list books. Filter books by ISBN and rack number.
- **Borrowing Management**: Handle borrowing requests, set book borrowing limits, and manage return dates.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on borrowed and available books.

### Normal User
- **Account Registration**: Sign up for an account and await approval from a librarian.
- **Book Search**: Search for books in the library using various criteria.
- **Book Borrowing**: Request to borrow books and view a history of borrowed books.
